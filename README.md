# Student login authentication and session authorization system

## *DS-UNIPI: Information Systems*

This is a Flask application.
It implements basic CRUD API services for a MongoDB database
along with a rudimentary login authentication and session authorization system.

---

### Setup

#### The Database side

* ##### mongodb docker image

    Even though this project would work with a MongoDB installation
    a **mongo docker image** is used for testing the project instead.
    Thus if installing MongoDB isn't preferred
    an installation of [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
    is sufficient for working with this project.
    
    **Pulling the mongo docker image** can be done with the command:
    
    `$ (sudo) docker pull mongo`
    
    For this project to work correctly, the mongodb docker container will
    have to be named **mongodb** and listen to **localhost's port 27017**,
    thus a mapping between the container's 27017 port (default for MongoDB)
    and the port 27017 port of the localhost.

    * `name:` mongodb
    * `port:` `localhost:27017 <--> mongodb:27017`

    This can be set running the mongo docker image with the command:

    `$ (sudo) docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo`

* ##### database

    The database named **InfoSys** will be running in the **mongodb docker container**.
    It will contain two collections:

    * the **Students** collection,

        * The *students.json* file can be used to populate the Students collection

            * Copy the *students.json* file into the mongodb docker container as:
            `$ (sudo) docker cp students.json mongodb:/students.json`

            * Import *students.json* into the **Students** collection in the **InfoSys** database using this command.
                ```bash
                $ (sudo) docker exec -it mongodb \
                  mongoimport --db=InfoSys --collection=Students --file=students.json
                ```

            (*this command will create the InfoSys database and the Students collection if they aren't yet present.*)

    * and the **Users** collection.

#### The Flask application

* ##### Python 3

    Running this application requires an installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

* ##### ( *recommended* ) *virtual enviroment*

    Using [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) allows for an isolated enviroment
    for running, testing and installing necessary packages for this project.
    
    To create a *virtual enviroment* with `virtualenv` named `env` enter:

    `$ virtualenv env`
    
    and to activate the *virtual enviroment* `env` enter the command
    
    `$ source env/bin/activate`
    
    to deactivate it enter:
    
    `$ deactivate`

* ##### pymongo and flask

    The application uses:

    * **pymongo** to interact with the database within the mongodb docker container
    * **flask** to implement the API Endpoints.

    Preferably using a *virtual enviroment* `pip` install **pymongo** and **flask** like so:

    `(env)...$ pip install pymongo flask`

* ##### *Initial `app.py`* script

    The **initial** `app.py` script (provided by the professors)
    can be described abstractly by the following steps:

    1. *Import all of the necessary modules for the whole project.*
    2. *Connect to the local mongodb and access the database InfoSys.*
    3.  *Select the Students and Users collections.*
    4.  *Initialize the flask application.*
    5.  *Define the `users_sessions` dictionary.*
    6.  *Define helper functions `create_session(username)` and `is_session_valid(user_uuid)`.*
    7.  *Define routes and function templates for all the required API-Endpoints and for each one:*
        * *implement the data fetching logic*
        * *include comments describing required functionality and desired status codes*
        * *return response on success*
    8.  *Start the flask application.*

    There are three important objects to understand in the setup part of the project:
    
    * The `users_sessions` dictionary:
    
        It is a dictionary which stores valid or active user sessions.
        Each user session is in the format: `user_uuid: (username, time)`.
        So the `users_sessions` at any point (if not empty) is in the form:
        
        ```text
        users_sessions: {
            user_uuid_1: [ username_1, time_1 ],
            user_uuid_2: [ username_2, time_2 ],
            
            ...         
            
            user_uuid_N: [ username_N, time_N ]
        }
        ```

        It is kept updated by `create_session(username)` during logings and
        is used by `is_session_valid(user_uuid)` for session authorization.

    * The `create_session(username)` function:
        Essentially it creates a new session for a user:
        1. It gets passed a `username` as an argument.
        2. It generates a uuid for the user with the use of the `uuid1()` of the `uuid` module.
        3. It inserts `user_uuid: (username, time)` as a new key-value in the `users_sessions` dictionary.
        4. It returns the generated `user_uuid`.

        ![create_session](images/createsession.png)

    * The `is_session_valid(user_uuid)` function:
        Checks if the user has a valid or active session:
        1. It gets passed a `user_uuid` as an argument. 
        2. It checks if the given `user_uuid` is a key in the `users_sessions` dictionary:
            * if it is, it returns `True`.
            * if it is **not**, it returns `False`.

        ![is_session_valid](images/issessionvalid.png)

#### Testing the application

It is recommended to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
for testing this application and to make requests to all the API Endpoints.
During testing the flask app and mongodb must be running,
the students collection must be populated with the students.json file.

---

### Implementing Project Requirements and Testing

The requirement for the project is the implementation of **9 *API Endpoints***
for the Flask application within the `app.py` script.

As already mentioned in the **Setup**, *the data fetching and validation logic* 
is already implemented, so these parts of the endpoints are not described here.

#### The API Endpoints

---

1. **`[ POST ] ( endpoint ): /createUser`**

    Expects user to pass json data to the body of the request.
    An example for the expected format for the json is shown:

    ```json
    {
        "username": "sherlock",
        "password": "sherl0cked"
    }
    ```

    The endpoint's method `create_user()` requests the json,
    handles the cases for exceptions, improper json content
    and incomplete json information, returning with the
    appropriate response for each case.

    * ##### Implementation

        1.  Check if a user with the username given in the data already exists in **Users**
            * if he does exist then return with an error response with `status = 400`
        
            this check is implemented with the following if statement:

            ```py
            if users.find( { 'username': data[ 'username' ] } ).count() != 0:
                return Response(
                        'A user with the given username already exists.',
                        status = 400,
                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

        2.  Insert the new user to **Users**. This is implemented using the following statement:

            ```py
            users.insert_one( {
                        'username': data[ 'username' ],
                        'password': data[ 'password' ]
                    } )
            ```

        3.  Return with a success response with `status = 200`, which is implemented as:

            ```py
            return Response(
                    'The user ' + data[ 'username' ] + ' was added to the database.',
                    status = 200,
                    mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

    * ##### Testing

        1.  In the terminal start the mogno shell in interactive mode by entering:

            `$ (sudo) docker exec -it mongodb mongo`

            Using database **InfoSys** find all Users (should be empty):
            
            ![](images/testing1a.png)

        2.  Use **Postman** to make the request.
        
            * Set the request method to **`POST`**.
            * Type **`localhost:5000/createUser`** in the **URL field**.
            * Write the request data as **`raw`** **`json`** in the request **body** as
            
                ```json
                {
                    "username": "sherlock",
                    "password": "sherl0cked"
                }
                ```

            * Push the **Send** button.

            As shown in the screenshot below, the request
            got a success response with `status = 200`:
            
            ![](images/testing1b.png)

            
        3.  Using mongo shell find all Users after the request (user is indeed inserted)
        
            ![](images/testing1c.png)

        4.  If a request to create a new user is made with the same
            username then since a user with this username already
            exists withing the User collections, an error response
            is returned with a `status = 400`:

            ![](images/testing1d.png)

2. **`[ POST ] ( endpoint ): /login`**

    Expects user to pass json data to the body of the request.
    An example for the expected format for the json is shown:

    ```json
    {
        "username": "sherlock",
        "password": "sherl0cked"
    }
    ```
    The endpoint's method `login()` requests the json,
    handles the cases for exceptions, improper json content
    and incomplete json information, returning with the
    appropriate response for each case.

    * ##### Implementation

        1.  Check if username and password correspond to an existing user in **Users**
            *   if there is no user with the provided username **and** password then
                return with an error response with `status = 400`
        
            this check is implemented with the following if statement:

            ``` py
            if users.find( {
                        'username': data[ 'username' ],
                        'password': data[ 'password' ]
                    } ).count() == 0:

                return Response(
                        'Wrong username or password.',
                        status = 400,
                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

        2.  Creat a new user-session:

            ```py
            user_uuid = create_session( data[ 'username' ] )
            ```

        3.  return with a success response containing the user-uuid with `status = 200`:

            ```py
            res = { 'uuid': user_uuid, 'username': data[ 'username' ] }

            return Response(
                    json.dumps( res ),
                    status = 200,
                    mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

    * ##### Testing

        1.  Use **Postman** to make the request.
        
            * Set the request method to **`POST`**.
            * Type **`localhost:5000/login`** in the **URL field**.
            * Write the request data as **`raw`** **`json`** in the request **body** as
            
                ```js
                {
                    "username": "sherlock",
                    "password": "morimorimoriarty" // wrong password
                }
                ```

            * Push the **Send** button.

            As shown in the screenshot below, the request
            got an error response with `status = 400`
            since the password did not match:
            
            ![](images/testing2a.png)

        2.  Use **Postman** to make the request.
        
            * Set the request method to **`POST`**.
            * Type **`localhost:5000/login`** in the **URL field**.
            * Write the request data as **`raw`** **`json`** in the request **body** as
            
                ```js
                {
                    "username": "sherlock",
                    "password": "sherl0cked" // correct password
                }
                ```
            * Push the **Send** button.

            As shown in the screenshot below, the request
            a success response with `status = 200`
            and in the response body we get a **uuid** along
            with the username which is used for authorization:
        
            ![](images/testing2b.png)

---

3. **`[ GET ] ( endpoint ): /getStudent`**

    Expects user to pass json data to the body of the request.
    An example for the expected format for the json is shown:

    ```json
    {
        "email": "frenchdale@ontagene.com"
    }
    ```
    The endpoint's method `get_student()` requests the json,
    handles the cases for exceptions, improper json content
    and incomplete json information, returning with the
    appropriate response for each case.

    The user has to be authorized to make a successful request.
    In other words the user must be logged in. In order to make the request
    the `Authorization` header must be set to the `uuid` of the login response.

    * ##### Implementation

        1.  ( *Authorization* )
            Retrieve the request authorization header ( the `user_uuid` ).
            *   If an exception occurs while retreiving authorization
                return with an error response `status = 500`

            ``` py
            user_uuid = None

            try:
                user_uuid = request.headers[ 'Authorization' ]
            except Exception:
                return Response(
                        'Authorization Key Error',
                        status = 500,
                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

            Validate authorization using `is_session_valid( user_uuid )`
            *   If the user is not authorized return with an error response `status = 401`

            ```py
            if not is_session_valid( user_uuid ):
                return Response(
                        'Unauthorized.',
                        status = 401,
                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

        2.  Search for a student with the provided email
            *   if no student with the provided email is found
                return with an error response `status = 400`

            ```py
            found = students.find_one( { 'email': data[ 'email' ] } )

            if not found:
                return Response(
                        'Student not found.',
                        status = 400,
                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

        3.  construct student dictionary and return
            with a success response containing the student `status = 200`:

            ```py
            student = {}

            for key in found.keys():
                if key == '_id':
                    continue
                student[ key ] = found[ key ]

            return Response(
                    json.dumps( student ),
                    status = 200,
                    mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

    * ##### Testing

        1.  Use **Postman** to make the request.
        
            *   Set the request method to **`GET`**.
            *   Type **`localhost:5000/getStudent`** in the **URL field**.
            *   Set **`Authorization`** header to a random value to test authorization check.

                ![](images/testing3a.png)

            *   Write the request data as **`raw`** **`json`** in the request **body** as
            
                ```js
                {
                    "email": "frenchdale68@ontagene.com" // email not in database
                }
                ```
            *   Push the **Send** button.

            As shown in the screenshot below, the request
            got an error response with `status = 401` *Unauthorized*
            since the uuid is invalid:

            ![](images/testing3b.png)
            

        2.  Use **Postman** to make the request.

            *   Set `Authorization` header to the **`uuid`**
                provided in the previous **login response**:

                ![](images/testing3c.png)

            *   Write the request data as **`raw`** **`json`** in the request **body** as
            
                ```js
                {
                    "email": "frenchdale@ontagene68.com" // email not in database
                }
                ```
            *   Push the **Send** button.

            As shown in the screenshot below, the request is authorized
            but an error response with `status = 400` is returned since
            no student with the provided email is found in the database.

            ![](images/testing3d.png)
         
        3.  Use **Postman** to make the request.

            *   Set `Authorization` header to the `uuid`
                provided in the previous login response:

                ![](images/testing3e.png)

            *   Write the request data as **`raw`** **`json`** in the request **body** as
            
                ```js
                {
                    "email": "frenchdale@ontagene.com" // email is in database
                }
                ```

            *   Push the **Send** button.

            As shown in the screenshot below, the request is authorized
            and a success response with `status = 200` is returned since
            a student with the provided email exists in the database. In
            the response the json information for the student is present.

            ![](images/testing3f.png)

---

4. **`[ GET ] ( endpoint ): /getStudents/thirties`**

    ( Authorization required )
    Respond with a list of 30 year-old students in database.

    The user has to be authorized to make a successful request.
    In other words the user must be logged in. In order to make the request
    the `Authorization` header must be set to the `uuid` of the login response.

    * ##### Implementation

        1.  ( *Authorization* )
            Retrieve the request authorization header ( the `user_uuid` )
            *   if an exception occurs while retreiving authorization
                return with an error response `status = 500`

                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

        2.  Get current year and search for 30 year-old students in the database:
            *   If no 30 year-old students are found in the database return with an error response:
    
            ```py
            current_year = datetime.today().year
            
            search_results = students.find( { 'yearOfBirth': ( current_year - 30 ) } )

            ```
        
        3.  Construct the students_thirties list:

            ```py
            students_thirties = []

            for result in results:
                student = {}

                for key in result.keys():
                    if key == '_id':

                students_thirties.append( student )
            ```

        4.  Return with a success response containing the students_thirties list `status = 200`:

            ```py
            return Response(
                    json.dumps( students_thirties ),
                    status = 200,
                    mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

    * ##### Testing

        1.  Use **Postman** to make the request.
        
            *   Set the request method to **`GET`**.
            *   Type **`localhost:5000/getStudents/thirties`** in the **URL field**.
            *   Set **`Authorization`** header to a random value to test authorization check.

            *   Push the **Send** button.

            As shown in the screenshot below, the request got
            an error response with `status = 401` *Unauthorized*
            since the uuid is invalid:

            ![](images/testing4a.png)
            

        2. Use **Postman** to make the request.

            *   Set `Authorization` header to the `uuid`
                provided in the previous login response:
            *   Push the **Send** button.

            As shown in the screenshot below, the request is authorized
            but a success response with `status = 200` is returned
            with the 30 year-old students in the database.

5. **`[ GET ] ( endpoint ): /getStudents/oldies`**

    ( Authorization required )
    Respond with a list of students that are at least 30 years old.

    The user has to be authorized to make a successful request.
    In other words the user must be logged in. In order to make the request
    the `Authorization` header must be set to the `uuid` of the login response.

    * ##### Implementation

        1.  ( *Authorization* )

            Retrieve the request authorization header ( the `user_uuid` ).

            *   If an exception occurs while retreiving authorization
                return with an error response `status = 500`:

            ``` py        
            user_uuid = None

            try:
                user_uuid = request.headers[ 'Authorization' ]
            except Exception:
                return Response(
                        'Authorization Key Error',

                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

            Validate authorization using `is_session_valid( user_uuid )`.
            *   If the user is not authorized return with an error response `status = 401`:

            ```py
            if not is_session_valid( user_uuid ):
                return Response(
                        'Unauthorized.',

            ```

        2.  Get current year and
            search for students that are at least 30 years old in the database:
            *   If no students over 30 are found in the database return with an error response:

            ```py
            current_year = datetime.today().year
            
            results = students.find( {
                'yearOfBirth': { '$lte': ( current_year - 30 ) }

                        mimetype = "application/json" )
            ```

        3.  Construct the students_oldies list:

            ```py
            students_oldies = []

            for result in results:
                student = {}

                for key in result.keys():
                    if key == '_id':
                        continue
                    student[ key ] = result[ key ]

                students_oldies.append( student )
            ```

        5.  Return with a success response containing the students_oldies list `status = 200`:

            ```py
            return Response(
                    json.dumps( students_oldies ),
                    status = 200,
                    mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

    * ##### Testing

        1.  Use **Postman** to make the request.

        2. Use **Postman** to make the request.

            *   Set `Authorization` header to the `uuid`
                provided in the previous login response:

            *   Push the **Send** button.

            As shown in the screenshot below, the request is authorized
            but a success response with `status = 200` is returned
            with all the students that are at least 30 years old in the database.

            ![](images/testing5b.png)

6. **`[ GET ] ( endpoint ): /getStudentAddress`**

    ( Authorization required )
    Find a student that has an address by a given email.

    The user has to be authorized to make a successful request.
    In other words the user must be logged in. In order to make the request
    the `Authorization` header must be set to the `uuid` of the login response.

    * ##### Implementation

        1.  ( *Authorization* )

            ```        

         2. Search for the student with the provided email in the Students collection.
            *   If no student with the provided email is found return with an error response:
            *   If the student found has no address return with an error response:

            ```py
            found = students.find_one( { 'email': data[ 'email' ] } )

            ```

    * ##### Testing

        1.  Use **Postman** to make the request.
        
            * Set the request method to **`GET`**.
            * Type **`localhost:5000/getStudentAddress`** in the **URL field**.
            
            *   Set **`Authorization`** header at random to test authorization check.

                ![](images/testing6a.png)

            *   Write the request data as **`raw`** **`json`** in the request **body** as
        
                ```js
                {
                    "email": "frenchdale@ontagene68.com" // email not in database
                }
                ```

            *   Push the **Send** button.

            As shown in the screenshot below, the request got
            an error response with `status = 401` *Unauthorized*
            since the uuid is invalid:

            ![](images/testing6b.png)

        2.  Using **Postman** make the request:
            
            * Set **`Authorization`** header to the login's response uuid.

            * Leave the request's body json data as it is.

            * Push the **Send** button.

            As shown in the screenshot below,
            the request was authorized,
            but since the email does not correspond to any student in the database
            the response has a `status = 400`:

            ![](images/testing6c.png)
        
        3.  In **Postman** make the request:

            *   Set the request's body json data to an existing email:

                ```js
                {
                    "email": "frenchdale@ontagene.com" // email in database
                }
                ```

            *   Everything else should remain unchanged.

            *   Press **Send**.

            As shown in the screenshot, the student was found
            but had no address, thus the response has `status = 400`

            ![](images/testing6d.png)
        
        4.  In **Postman** make the request:

            *   Set the request's body json data to an existing email:

                ```js
                {
                    "email": "irenepearson@ontagene.com" // has address
                }
                ```

            *   Everything else should remain unchanged.

            *   Press **Send**.

            As shown in the screenshot, the student was found and
            had an address, thus the response has `status = 200`
            and it contains the student address information

            ![](images/testing6e.png)

7. **`[ DELETE ] ( endpoint ): /deleteStudent`**

    Expects user to pass json data to the body of the request.
    An example for the expected format for the json is shown:

    ```json
    {
        "email": "blancheday@ontagene.com"
    }
    ```
    The endpoint's method `delete_student()` requests the json,
    handles the cases for exceptions, improper json content
    and incomplete json information, returning with the
    appropriate response for each case.

    The user has to be authorized to make a successful request.
    In other words the user must be logged in. In order to make the request
    the `Authorization` header must be set to the `uuid` of the login response.

    * ##### Implementation

        1.  ( *Authorization* )

            Retrieve the request authorization header ( the `user_uuid` ).

            *   If an exception occurs while retreiving authorization
                return with an error response `status = 500`

            ``` py        
            user_uuid = None

            try:
                user_uuid = request.headers[ 'Authorization' ]
            except Exception:
                return Response(
                        'Authorization Key Error',
                        status = 500,
                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

            Validate authorization using `is_session_valid( user_uuid )`.

            *   If the user is not authorized return with an error response `status = 401`:

            ```py
            if not is_session_valid( user_uuid ):
                return Response(
                        'Unauthorized.',
                        status = 401,
                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

        2.  Try to delete the student with the provided email from the Students collection.
            *   If the student with the given email wasn't deleted return with an error response.

            ```py
            if students.delete_one( { 'email': data['email'] } ).deleted_count == 0:
                return Response(
                        'Student not found.',
                        status = 400,
                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```
        4.  Return with a success response.

            ```py
            return Response(
                    'Student deleted successfully.',
                    status = 200,
                    mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

    * ##### Testing

        1.  Use **Postman** to make the request.
        
            *   Set the request method to **`DELETE`**.
            *   Type **`localhost:5000/deleteStudent`** in the **URL field**.
            
            *   Set **`Authorization`** header at random to test authorization check.

                ![](images/testing7a.png)

            *   Write the request data as **`raw`** **`json`** in the request **body** as
        
                ```js
                {
                    "email": "dunlapfoley@ontagene68.com" // email not in database
                }
                ```

            *   Push the **Send** button.

            As shown in the screenshot below, the request got
            an error responses with `status = 401` *Unauthorized*
            since the uuid is invalid:

            ![](images/testing7b.png)

        2.  Using **Postman** make the request:
            
            *   Set **`Authorization`** header to the login's response uuid.

            *   Leave the same email in body's raw json data

            *   Push the **Send** button.

            As shown in the screenshot below,
            the request was authorized,
            but since the email does not correspond to any student in the database
            the response has a `status = 400`:

            ![](images/testing7c.png)
        
        3.  In **Postman** make the request:

            *   Set the request's body json data to an existing email:

                ```js
                {
                    "email": "dunlapfoley@ontagene.com" // email in database
                }
                ```

                This email corresponds to an existing student in the database
                
                ![](images/testing7d.png)

            *   Everything else should remain unchanged.

            *   Press **Send**.

            As shown in the screenshot, the student was found
            and deleted successfully thus the response has the `status = 200`.

            ![](images/testing7e.png)

            Indeed, if we search for the student in mongo shell,
            the student is no longer present.

8. **`[ PATCH ] ( endpoint ): /addCourses`**

    Expects user to pass json data to the body of the request.
    An example for the expected format for the json is shown:

    ```json
    {
        "email": "velazquezreilly@ontagene.com"
    }
    ```
    The endpoint's method `get_passed_courses()` requests the json,
    handles the cases for exceptions, improper json content
    and incomplete json information, returning with the
    appropriate response for each case.

    The user has to be authorized to make a successful request.
    In other words the user must be logged in. In order to make the request
    the `Authorization` header must be set to the `uuid` of the login response.

    * ##### Implementation

        1.  ( *Authorization* )
            Retrieve the request authorization header ( the `user_uuid` ).

            *   If an exception occurs while retreiving authorization
                return with an error response `status = 500`:

            ``` py
            user_uuid = None

            try:
                user_uuid = request.headers[ 'Authorization' ]
            except Exception:
                return Response(
                        'Authorization Key Error',
                        status = 500,
                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

            Validate authorization using `is_session_valid( user_uuid )`.

            *   If the user is not authorized return with an error response `status = 401`:

            ```py
            if not is_session_valid( user_uuid ):
                return Response(
                        'Unauthorized.',
                        status = 401,
                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

        2.  Check if the courses provided in the data are in proper format:

            *   If courses is not a list return with an error response:

            ```py
            if not isinstance( data[ 'courses' ], list ):
                return Response(
                        'courses should be a list.',
                        status = 500,
                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

            *   If any item in the courses list is not a one-key dictionary with an integer value
                then return with an error response:

            ```py
            for item in data[ 'courses' ]:
                if ( not isinstance( item, dict ) or
                        len( item ) != 1 or
                                not isinstance( list( item.values() )[ 0 ], int ) ):

                    return Response(
                            'courses should only contain '
                                    + 'one-key integer-value dictionaries.',
                            status = 500,
                            mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

        3.  Try to add the courses to the student.
            *   If no student matched the provided email return with an error response:

            ```py
            if students.update_one(
                    { 'email': data[ 'email' ] },
                    { '$set': { 'courses': data[ 'courses' ] } } ).matched_count == 0:

                return Response(
                        'Student not found.',
                        status = 400,
                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

        4.  Return with a success response:

            ```py
            return Response(
                    'Student updated successfully.',
                    status = 200,
                    mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

    * ##### Testing

        1.  Use **Postman** to make the request.
            
            *   Set the request method to **`PATCH`**.

            *   Type **`localhost:5000/addCourses`** in the **URL field**.
            
            *   Set **`Authorization`** header at random to test authorization check.
                ![](images/testing8a.png)

            *   Write the request data as **`raw`** **`json`** in the request **body** as

                ```js
                {
                    // email not in database
                    "email": "velazquezreilly68@ontagene.com",

                    // courses in improper format
                    "courses": [
                        "Mathematics",
                        "Literature",
                        "Geography" 
                    ]
                }
                ```

            *   Push the **Send** button.

            As shown in the screenshot below, the request got
            an error responses with `status = 401` *Unauthorized*
            since the uuid is invalid:

            ![](images/testing8b.png)

        2.  Using **Postman**:

            *   Set **`Authorization`** header at uuid from the login.

            *   Leave everything else in the request as it is in.

            *   **Send** the request:

            As shown in the screenshot below, the uuid is valid and the response is authorized.
            But since courses is improperly formatted, the response has a `status = 500` and
            the response message is informing about the improper format of the courses list.

            ![](images/testing8c.png)

        3.  Using **Postman**:

            *   Write the request data as **`raw`** **`json`** in the request **body** as:

                ```js
                {
                    // email not in database
                    "email": "velazquezreilly68@ontagene.com",

                    // courses in proper format
                    "courses": [
                        { "Mathematics": 4 },
                        { "Literature": 8 },
                        { "Geography": 6 } 
                    ]
                }
                ```

            *   Leave everything else in the request as it is in.

            *   **Send** the request:

            As shown in the screenshot below, the uuid is valid and the response is authorized.
            The request json body data are in proper format.
            But since no student matched the provided email,
            the response has a `status = 400` "Student not found.":

            ![](images/testing8d.png)

        4.  Using **Postman**:

            *   Write the request data as **`raw`** **`json`** in the request **body** as:

                ```js
                {
                    // email in database
                    "email": "velazquezreilly@ontagene.com",

                    // courses in proper format
                    "courses": [
                        { "Mathematics": 4 },
                        { "Literature": 8 },
                        { "Geography": 6 } 
                    ]
                }
                ```

                As shown in the screenshot below, the email correspond to an existing student
                with no courses.

                ![](images/testing8e.png)

            *   Leave everything else in the request as it is in.

            *   **Send** the request:

            As shown in the screenshot below, the uuid is valid and the response is authorized.
            The request json body data are in proper format.
            The student matched the provided email,
            the response has a `status = 200` "Student updated successfully.":

            ![](images/testing8f.png)

            The request was indeed successful as it is shown in the screenshot below,
            that the student has courses added.

9. **`[ GET ] ( endpoint ): /getPassedCourses`**

    Expects user to pass json data to the body of the request.
    An example for the expected format for the json is shown:

    ```json
    {

                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

            Validate authorization using `is_session_valid( user_uuid )`.
            *   If the user is not authorized return with an error response `status = 401`:

            ```py

            ```
        
        2.  Search database for the student with the provided email.
            *   If no student with the provided email is found return with an error response:

            ``` py
            found = students.find_one( { 'email': data[ 'email' ] } )

            if not found:
                return Response(
                        'Student not found.',
                        status = 400,
                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```
        
            If the student found has no courses return with an error response:

            ```py
            if 'courses' not in found:
                return Response(
                        'The student with the email '
                                + data[ 'email' ]
                                + ' has no courses.',

                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```
        
        3.  Filter passed courses.
            *   If the student has no passed courses return with an error response:

            ```py
            passed_courses = []

            for course in found[ 'courses' ]:
                if 5 <= list( course.values() )[ 0 ]:
                    passed_courses.append( course )

            if len( passed_courses ) == 0:
                return Response(
                        'The student with the email '
                                + data[ 'email' ]
                                + ' has no passed courses.',

                        mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```
        
        4.  Construct output and return with a success respond
            containing the output `statys = 200`:

            ```py
            student = { 'name': found[ 'name' ], 'passed courses': passed_courses }

            return Response(
                    json.dumps( student ),
                    status = 200,
                    mimetype = 'application/json' )
            ```

    * ##### Testing

        1.  Use **Postman** to make the request.
            
            *   Set the request method to **`GET`**.

            *   Type **`localhost:5000/getPassedCourses`** in the **URL field**.
            
            *   Set **`Authorization`** header at random to test authorization check.
                ![](images/testing9a.png)

            *   Write the request data as **`raw`** **`json`** in the request **body** as

                ```js
                {
                    "email": "lavonneleon@ontagene67.com" // email not in database
                }
                ```

            *   Push the **Send** button.

            As shown in the screenshot below, the request got
            an error responses with `status = 401` *Unauthorized*
            since the uuid is invalid:

            ![](images/testing9b.png)

        2.  Use **Postman** to make the request.

            *   Set **`Authorization`** header to the uuid in the login response:

            *   Leave the rest of the request as it is.

            *   **Send** the request.

            As shown in the screenshot below, the request was authorized.
            But since the email doesn't correspond to a student in the database,
            an error response returns with `status = 400`

            ![](images/testing9c.png)

        3.  Use **Postman** to make the request.

            *   Write the request data as **`raw`** **`json`** in the request **body** as

                ```js
                {
                    "email": "lavonneleon@ontagene.com" // email in database
                }
                ```

                The screenshot of the mongo shell below confirms that the student
                with the email in the data indeed exists in the database and has
                no courses.

                ![](images/testing9d.png)

            *   Leave the rest of the request as it is.

            *   Push the **Send** button.

            As shown in the screenshot below, the request was authorized,
            the student was found, but since the student has not courses
            an error response got returned.

            ![](images/testing9e.png)

        4.  Use **Postman** to make the request.

            *   Write the request data as **`raw`** **`json`** in the request **body** as

                ```js
                {
                    // student with this email has courses
                    "email": "velazquezreilly@ontagene.com"
                }
                ```

                The screenshot of the mongo shell below confirms that the student
                with the email in the data indeed exists in the database and has
                courses.

                ![](images/testing9f.png)

            *   Leave the rest of the request as it is.

            *   Push the **Send** button.

            As shown in the screenshot below, the request was authorized,
            the student was found, and the student has passed courses.
            So the response has a `status = 200`.
